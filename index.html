<p>
<em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>       <sup>1</sup> is a character and story-driven adventure game developed by Infinite Fall which was released on Steam in February of 2017. The title deals with a multitude of issues concerning the “Millennial” and
“Generation Z” generations including identity, mental illness, generational conflicts, existential angst, and the process of maturing. It is highly praised for displaying gender and sexuality in a casual, yet representative manner by weaving elements of it into the story
without specifically putting it in the center of attention.

<p>
<em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>portrays its characters as anthropomorphic animals in an angular and colorful cartoon style. The simple fact that the characters are animals is the first layer of obscurity in terms of gender stereotypes, although even
without this design choice the game is quite cautious in how it treats gender: Mae, the main protagonist and playable character, is an androgynous-looking female cat in her twenties (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="index.html#1">1</a>). As seen in Figure&nbsp;<a
href="index.html#2">2</a>, many Steam users of the game were not able to determine Mae’s gender based on her looks and behavior alone, creating discussions about gender expression within the game’s community.
</p>

<p>
When the game <em>does</em> portray gender stereotypes, it is almost always in the form of social commentary or allegories. Looking at Mae’s family in the game, for instance, the player will notice it consists of two bigger cats wearing
stereotypical male and female clothing with the mother reading a book and the father watching television on the sofa. This is a nod to the popular trope of the “nuclear family unit” which has been criticized in the scope of western
familism of “Generation X”. This generational divide is very prominent in this game, focusing on the younger ideologies of family, gender, and sexuality of “Gen Y/Z” in contrast to the more traditional values of “Gen X”.<sup>2</sup>

<p>
While certain characters might lean more heavily into gender-stereotypes than others, all characters are fleshed out as ordinary people that are not a mere caricature of their real-life counterparts. As mentioned above, Mae is a very
androgynous, yet Gregg is portrayed as a male anarchist fox with a tendency for crime and violence. He is often seen wearing a leather jacket and appears in scenes with male-associated activities (see Figure&nbsp;<a
href="index.html#3">3</a>). Despite the stereotypical male behaviors and clothing, Gregg is also homosexual and has dialogues outlining his softer side, demonstrating the game’s understanding and acknowledgment
of these stereotypes. On the opposite side of the spectrum lies Angus, Gregg’s male partner. He is a chubby, soft-spoken and introverted bear. He exhibits visual stereotypes, such as the big and strong nature of a bear, while acting in
more effeminate ways. Bea, the second female of the main protagonists, exhibits more male-typical behavior while being more effeminate in her looks; This is the polar opposite of Angus in terms of averting gender expectations.

<h5 id="autosec-11"><span class="sectionnumber" >2.2&#x2003;</span>Mono-Cultural Themes</h5>
<a id="Simader11823075_NightInTheWoods-autopage-11"></a>


<p>
Being set in the fictional “Possum Springs”, a once prosperous but now largely forgotten small rural town in the USA, the game is heavily focused on portraying American, specifically post-recession, culture. While it does this very
well, the game can not be asked to give insight to people from different cultural backgrounds since the varying circumstances simply make the experience less relatable. It is notable that the game appears mostly self-aware of the
limitations and utilizes its naturalistic story-telling as a way to justify this. <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>specifically applies culture as one of its central themes and lets the player learn about the history of the fictional
town and its inhabitants. This happens both through subtle suggestions in the overarching story, but also through more overt displays. For instance, one can talk to the many non-playable characters of Possum Springs to learn about its
economic downfall. While the game does not lean into this aspect heavily, development studios can certainly learn from <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods’ </em>style of portraying culture as something that one can study, explore
and ponder; many other games simply exploit culture as an aesthetic or gimmick, or omit any reference to it entirely.
</p>
<h5 id="autosec-12"><span class="sectionnumber" >2.3&#x2003;</span>Sexuality and Sexualization of Characters</h5>
<a id="Simader11823075_NightInTheWoods-autopage-12"></a>


<p>
As Nichole Johnson outlines in her article on LGBTQ+ representation in <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em><sup>4</sup>, the game has a very effective way of portraying LGBTQ+ characters and their relationships. Instead
of going the route of inserting queerness into the story just for the sake of having it, or displaying it like in a museum, the game takes a naturalistic approach; The characters simply state their sexuality when it is relevant to do so. Out
of the four main characters, two are homosexual and one is pansexual, although the game never outright confirms Mae’s pansexuality since Mae does not express herself as openly as Gregg and Angus – the game’s gay couple. This
parallels the experience of many adolescents and teenagers in the real world who would rather be represented as a relatable character that happens to be gay than a flamboyant individual who bases their identity on their sexuality. On
the other hand, some criticism has also been voiced regarding the decision not to state sexuality overtly. Some members of the LGBTQ+ community actually argue that this is a harmful practice.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>
</p>

<p>
Either way, for the sake of inclusivity and player expression there is no doubt that having the player explore the characters’ and their own sexuality through their choices is vital for any modern story-driven game similar to
<em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods. </em>It is a welcome sight to see the possibility to either pursue a male or a female love interest for Mae, as S. Smith describes in their article:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
“She [Mae] never explicitly confirms her bisexuality<sup>6</sup> – a pet peeve that I know some members of the community have. Instead, you learn that from the fact that she wants to date or dated men and women. Her high school
prom date, Cole, was a boy [...]. And there are at least two moments in the game I played which I could actively flirt with women.”<sup>7</sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Furthermore, <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>is effective in representing not only the sexuality of its characters but also their interactions with sexuality itself. While sex and pornography are rarely mentioned in the game,
the times these topics do inevitably come up within this close circle of friends feel natural and not oversexualized for the audience – and neither do any of the characters themselves for that matter.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
“In video games, they are caricatures of real gay men and woman or they are hyper sexualized villains. Not in <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods. </em>Gregg and Angus are Mae’s best friends and they are there for her till the
end.”<sup>8</sup>

<p>
<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;It seems that some claim Mae is bisexual while others state her as being pansexual. This boils down to a minor line of dialogue, stating that Mae “does not care whether she dates a boy or a girl” (<a
id="LWR-ht-cite.0:t:1:nitw"></a>Infinite Fall. <em>Night in the Woods</em>. Video Game. Finji, Feb. 2017, paraphrased). Whether this implies pansexuality or not is not practically relevant.

<a id="Simader11823075_NightInTheWoods-autopage-17"></a>


<p>
As many scientific studies have demonstrated in the past, the literature children consume has a definite impact on their views of gender identity and sexuality as they mature into adults. The exact mechanisms by which television and
computers factor into this process is still actively being researched, as I. Steyer outlines; “It is argued that exposure of children to other non-sexist media may result in similarly positive effects on children as exposure to non-sexist
literature has been found to have.”<sup>9</sup>
</p>

<p>
The appeal for children in <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>lies not only in its colorful, anthropomorphic and picture-book-esque art-style but also in the way important topics such as gender identity and sexuality are
presented. As previously touched upon, the game presents these topics in a casual and natural way. This may be beneficial to children since it normalizes these concepts by showing acceptance in a day-to-day setting. Furthermore, the
balance of the number of male to female characters appears to be very well considered by the developers. Looking at the main cast, for instance, two male and two female protagonists are found, importantly with the main playable
character being female <em>and</em> pansexual. Despite developers’ best efforts, female, let alone LGBTQ+, characters are still largely underrepresented in video games and on the internet today.<sup>10</sup>

<h5 id="autosec-19"><span class="sectionnumber" >3.2&#x2003;</span>Target Audience</h5>
<a id="Simader11823075_NightInTheWoods-autopage-19"></a>


<p>
As mentioned in previous sections, <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>is geared towards an American audience with birth-years ranging from approximately 1985-2012 – the age-range of “Generation Y and Z". There is no
clear indication of whether the game is male or female-oriented, as the player has the liberty of pursuing either a male or female love interest. Despite the main playable character Mae being female, the game itself is kept gender-neutral
for the most part. One can see that the development studio put a lot of work into making <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>relatable for as wide of an audience as possible while still having a unique character and culturally
specific topics that do not “pander to the masses”, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
Although some parents argue against the exposure of LGBTQ+ concepts to children, the majority seems to agree on the importance of showing kids tolerance towards marginalized groups. On a website dedicated to letting parents rate
video games on how suitable they were for their children of a specific age, many positive comments can be found talking about the representation and expression of gender and sexuality in <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods.
</em>One of the most-often cited problems for the game being potentially non-child-friendly for parents of children aged 10-14 was the obscene language used by the main protagonists and town inhabitants. Deciding whether or not to
expose one’s children to this kind of language is the responsibility of the parent; Arguments for and against exposure to such words and phrases can be made.<sup>11</sup>

<a id="Simader11823075_NightInTheWoods-autopage-21"></a>


<p>
In summary, <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>is a shining example of a game which presents many difficult topics, including gender identity, sexuality, culture, “teen-angst”, maturation, etc. The developers were clearly
critical of gender stereotypes and representing a wide variety of minorities in their game. When gender stereotypes or sexuality <em>are</em> mentioned or shown, the game does this to either avert our expectations or present a critical
analysis of cultural or societal experiences. The LGBTQ+ protagonists and non-playable characters are depicted in a naturalistic manner which helps the audience relate to, and build an emotional connection to them. Furthermore, the
contrast of ideas between generations “X” and “Y/Z” leads to a progressive message for children and adolescents, as well as adults. Where other games commodify, exaggerate, and exploit, <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods
</em>tries to be taken seriously as artistic piece which challenges the consumer to question their identity and surroundings. Despite the many positives, there are surely many aspects of the game that can see improvements in future
titles; The broader scope of the game is very limited to the “western” understanding of society, government and economics, for one example. Ultimately, <em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>is an experiment of a video game for
the sole purpose of self-exploration of a specific demographic, and hopefully empathy for this demographic among the general population. S. Greer, a queer author, writes the following in his article on the game:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
“What it [<em>Night&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Woods </em>] manages to say about the dynamics of being queer in a middle of nowhere town, small as it may be, is the part that lingers with me. In the progressive views of its youth, a mirror
that holds up well to my lived experience, there is comfort to be found.”<sup>12</sup>
